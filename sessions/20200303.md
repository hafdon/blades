## soren
ancient ghosts: the reconciled

a whitewashed pedestal with a large glass jar sitting on top of it. the jar is full of what looks like dark brown, dry soil

gob eats the soil
sort of like the eucharist

area around refineries gets filled with acid rain, mutagenics, and ghosts
grinders are former workers who got sick of that, and they are unionizing and killing the factory leaders
have a derelict warship, and want to start the revolution

bryce, the teenage skovland boy, trying to get through doing her workout

weaver's background: was a shaman in the dagger isles
orion will write-up weaver getting introduced to one of the reconciled
weaver is bizarrely grounded; to her, spirits are reality

orion: how is weaever as conversationalist (pragmatic, not intellectual
shamans aren't lorekeepers or historians. it's more practical.

Ulf recognizes weaver

soren feels about the grinders: not sure if he thinks they are dangerous enough

grinders: 
smash and grab
propaganda
bohemian artists and performers (skovlanders)

Munghole at very edge of Coalridge; originally owned by people who weren't the grinders -- protection raquet

Slaine -- 
- is in some way trying to protect the Wheedle Man
What does slaine really care about
1. greater factory output: he gets more off the top
1. sadist and must be in control of others' lives

Soren can recharge self with Spirit Wells

Dr. Morriston: is there a way to ground a possessing spirit
studies as an elite
but the body in a lightning cage
morriston wants us to try to use the fine lightning hook

IF you covered someone in blacksalt, a spirit can't leave their body
the WM is still active: can sense fear and unease that emerges from people as they discuss having seen him. doesn't appear as a noticeable manifestation or disruption in ghost field we'd sense through possession.
