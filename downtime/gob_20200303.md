# downtime

My vice purveyor, Shoemaker Byte (Sharp Trousers, counts on fingers a lot) and Sprinkly (lives in a trailer, Rockford Files-style(s) )

Gob: Uh, hey, Byte.  
Byte: Hello there.  
Sprinkly: Yay!  
_Gob looks nonplussed_  
Sprinkly: Gob, have you run into any more demons.  
Gob: Not since that one under the train station. Why, what's up?  
Byte: He won't stop talking about that fucking demon.  
Sprinkly: I just think it's so cool! (And to stick it to the _jacks_!)
Byte: Leave him alone, he just wants to chill.  
Sprinkly: Sure, yeah, uh, you want some tea?  
Gob: (waving off Byte) That sounds great, little dude.  
Sprinkly: (dipping into a battered tin can) We've got ... 'slimy hedgehog' and 'burnt hoof' and 'grizzled hocks' ...  
Gob: What is all this?   
Byte: It's the ...
Sprinkly: ... it's all the types of mushrooms we've got! (continues) 'goat's liver' ... and ... 'green-spored grub' ... 'cressweed' ... 'fake cressweed' ... --
Gob: Yeah, the last one.  
Sprinkly:  ... Which last one? The cressweed, or --  
Gob: Yes, perfect, that one.  
Sprinkly: Oooh, you're gonna like it so much.  
_Sprinkly keeps talking as Byte moves in close to Gob_  
Byte: (in a low tone) Remina's not here today. I think just Mara and Vey are down there.  
Gob: Okay, yeah, Vey and I have tried together before. It wasn't terrible. Can you --
Byte: Yeah, I'll just toss the tea. _Khel Sohv_, brother.  
Gob: _Khel Sov_, sister.  

Gob proceeds down the stairs, which open into a low-ceilined den hung with thick earth-colored tapestries; some look to be made from hides of animals only known to survive on The Dagger Isles. The floor is covered in an ankle-deep layer of soft dried paper pulp which exudes a cloud of greyish dust when disturbed. He takes hesitant steps towards a whitewashed pedestal on top of which sits a large glass jar containing dry, dark brown soil. Lifting the heavy glass lid from the jar, Gob reaches in a hand and pulls up a clenched fist full of the loose earth. He steels himself momentarily and then gobbles up the dirt, taking vast reckless bites and chewing wildly before swallowing the globus. His clean hand reaches out to grab the edge of the pedestal and steady him, but before he finds support he collapses backwards into the powdery carpeting.
