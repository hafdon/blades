# The meeting with Setarra

Gob remained standing, and the door wavered back and forth with the motion of the water which, in contrast to the ocean, was transparent: a dark jade muted by the grey architecture of the tavern and scattered supellex the color of eelsblood. At the far end of the tavern, suspended in the water, loomed a massive amphibe whose bulk appeared too large for the space. A humaniod torso blended into a thick tail, lazily undulating and beset with ribbonlike, almost gossamer fins running down length. The creature's integument consisted of small, lavender scales which began at its neck and covered the entire body downwards. A corallaceous, baby-blue crest protruded from the had of its head, and its three-foot length terminated in a tidy, thinning spiral. The curious phantasm, innocuous at first, revealed a deeper menace upon perscrutation of the eyes: three orbs set into the forehead like jewels in a diadem, each the size of an imperial silvercoin, their etherial border a perfect circles of deep black, and the center space a translucent globe of electric blue.

Setarra: You seem out of sorts, Gob.
Gob: Just, um, cautious.
Setarra: Let me see if I can put you at ease. Have you heard of 'The Goddess of the Undersea Moon'?
Gob: I think I may have read something about that. The goddess named ... Fengari?
Setarra: Ooh, we're getting at true names now. Remember anything about her ... extended family?
Gob: I ... my true name ...? What is it? I suddenly can't remember.
Setarra: Shoot, I've mixed you up already. You know, this is what happens when I try to conduct these things with a _mise-en-scene_ appropriate to the occasion. Let me try something.  

_The tavern begins to empty of water, draining from the floor up to the ceiling. As the air rises over Setarra's body, she assumes the form of a tall Severosi warrior, clad in furs and holding onto a halberd. Her centermost eye disappears and the crest on her head is replaced by a single coalblack ram's horn._

Setarra: I don't think we need to worry about true names yet.
Gob: No ... It'd be a relief if we didn't have to.
Setarra: Wonderful. I'm __SETARRA__

_Gob is alone and crouching atop a high stone column crumbling with age. Around him are the bleak plains of Severos which stretch out impossibly to the horizon. Looking at the sky above is like looking at the surface of the ocean from the ocean floor, only instead of water and the punctuated radiance of light through the liquid ripples there are only the black-ringed, electric blue, unblinking eyes of the demon, and in each eye for an infinite moment swim the ichorous dripping letters of his true name. The eyes then slide over and on top of one another until, stacked like electric suns rimmed by a black hole, they resolve into Setarra's center eye, which is now safely motionless in her forehead._

Setarra: Ultimately we had to get it out of the way. Now. I've heard through the rotberryvine that you'd like a teeny tête-à-tête with a demon. What's wrong with the one you have prisoner next to your little boat?
Gob: Well, that chain it's wrapped in doesn't give it a whole lot of incentive to cooperate with me. Even if it did -- and I didn't know demons were this mondaine -- it's an inveterate gossip.
