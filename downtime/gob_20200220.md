Ministry of Preservation
The Ministry of Preservation manages the provisions for the Imperium, ensuring that food and supplies are transported where they’re needed across the electro-rail lines and within the cities. They also oversee the Sparkwrights who design and maintain the lightning barriers. They are appointed by the Emperor.
faction clock: seize control of leviathan hunters
Turf: The electro-rail train lines of the Imperium. Radiant energy farms, eeleries, and other food-growing enterprises throughout the city.
NPCs: Lord Dalmore (executive officer in Doskvol, commanding, intelligent). Lady Slane (chief of operations, insightful, subtle, effective). Captain Lannock (mercenary commander, shrewd, ruthless).
Notable Assets: A fleet of cargo ships and their armed escorts. A significant treasury from taxation and transportation licensing. The Rail Jacks who work the train lines. A private mercenary company that answers only to the ministry itself.
Allies: The Billhooks, Imperial Military, Rail Jacks, Sparkwrights.
Enemies: Leviathan Hunters.

Situation: The Ministry leadership believes that the leviathan hunters are too vital to the public well-being to be controlled by the bickering noble houses, vulnerable to their petty rivalries and vendettas. Agents within the ministry have been tasked with a variety of espionage, sabotage, and political actions to ultimately seize control of the hunters and bring them into Ministry control.

Imperial Military (vi): The armed forces of the Imperium stationed in Doskvol. Garrisons are posted at Gaddoc Rail Station, aboard the naval destroyer Paragon, and at the Lord Governor’s stronghold (about 250 troops in total)

As I step out into the Nightmarket fog, a little behind my companions — jetta; sorin, who i think lets me see her beyond my familiarity with her grim plane; this new one, Weaver, and the heavy, buttery smell of rich cigar smoke —  and  approached by a striking woman who I know by description only; wearing a bright, emerald-green wig, its longest strands just kissing her waist, whom none would dare emulate. This is Sister Thorn, one of the clocha (members ; lit. stones ) of the deathlands scavenger gang ainensilta (The Red Bridges or Blood Bridges) near Gaddoc Station. I suppose it's possible that she heard I was running a job for Seresha; I'm not quite sure what their relationships is like these days. I'd prefer it to be friendly. 

It hasn't been as easy to learn how to "pleasure" people as I thought it would. Especially when you're doing it, as it were, from the inside out. And once I got down there face to face with "Khelfaraz,"  it was hard not to get a contact buzz from all the promises, all the foretastes and expectations trickling down from those husks. (I have to hand it to Sorin -- if all I had was a sword and a spirit, I sure as shit wouldn't have tried to hold up the rear alone.) I don't know why it bothers with these sorts of contractual interactions; although lounged there amongst all that rock, lubricious and breathlessly oozing, it may have become accustomed to using itself as a carrot: the infinite temptations dreamt of through sloth and indolence, all the while having one's very substance siphoned into a fence to keep you from your prey. But there they were, each drop of longing as pure and self-contained as a marble, a world unto itself, in which you see the person who aches, but upside down. And, like a marble, they each bore an unmistakable pattern of rigidity, of crystallization, of the tremendous, tectonic process through which that demon can turn all lies into all desires. It was … easy. As easy as it's been hard, getting what I want to know the other ways. Just breath in a little, open my mouth wide, and take one of those silky, fractured spheres deep inside my lungs, to where that pattern can become a passage -- a passage to transcendence. Or a plague.
